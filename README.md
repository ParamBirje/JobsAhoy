<!-- Setting up the project -->

## Running locally

#### Pre-requisites

- Node v18.19 or above
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm or bun)

The project can be setup deployed using 2 ways one being through Docker (automated) and the other being manually. If you choose to go with the automated way, you will need:

- Docker with Docker Compose v2

Else with the manual method:

- MySQL
- MySQL workbench (optional, for GUI interface)

Let's start with the steps that are common for both of the deployment methods.

- Clone the repo to your local client
- Change directory into the project directory `cd JobsAhoy`
- Inside the project directory, install the required JS dependencies using your favourite package manager
  - Using npm `npm install`
  - Using yarn `yarn`
  - Using pnpm `pnpm install`
  - Using bun `bun install` _(faster)_
- Create a `.env` file and copy all the data from `.env.example` into it. For now don't edit anything, we will get back to this later.
- After the dependencies are installed, you can access the app in your browser on `localhost:3000` by running
  - Using npm `npm run dev`
  - Using yarn `yarn dev`
  - Using pnpm `pnpm run dev`
  - Using bun `bun run dev` _(faster)_

Great job! The website is up and running, but it would need a database for functioning. Only to setup the MySQL database, we now split into either paths (using Docker or setting it up manually).

#### Docker

#### Manually

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contributing

Unfortunately at the moment, the project is **not** open for contributions.

### Additional

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
