<!-- Setting up the project -->

## Running locally

#### Pre-requisites

- Node v18.19 or above
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm or bun)

The project can be setup deployed using 2 ways one being through Docker (automated) and the other being manually. If you choose to go with the automated way, you will need:

- Docker with Docker Compose v2

Else with the manual method:

- MySQL v8.3 or above
- MySQL workbench (optional, for GUI interface)

Let's start with the steps that are common for both of the deployment methods.

- Clone the repo to your local client
- Change directory into the project directory `cd JobsAhoy`
- Inside the project directory, install the required JS dependencies using your favourite package manager
  - Using npm `npm install`
  - Using yarn `yarn`
  - Using pnpm `pnpm install`
  - Using bun `bun install` _(faster)_
- Create a `.env` file and copy all the data from `.env.example` into it. For now don't edit anything, we will get back to this later.

Great job! Before we get the website up and running, we need a database for functioning. Only to setup the MySQL database, we now split into either paths (using Docker **or** setting it up manually).

#### Docker

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose v2 installed.

- Make sure no service, especially local MySQL, is running on port `3306` ([stop them if running](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/start-mysql-server))
- Open the `.env` file we created earlier, and edit:
  - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, Set any password that you want, Docker will use this value when initialising the database.
- Inside the project folder, run this command to start the container

```
docker compose --env-file .env up --build
```

- Make sure you get his message at the end >> `jobsahoy_mysql_dummy  | 2024-03-01T12:59:16.781825Z 0 [System] [MY-010931] [Server] /usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections. Version: '8.3.0'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server - GPL` which confirms the database is ready to receive connections.

#### Manually

Ensure you have MySQL 8.3^ installed. You can optionally use MySQL Workbench for an easier UI based configuration and setup procedure or use the old-school CLI way.

- [Create a new database schema](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-to-create-a-database-schema-with-the-MySQL-Workbench) named `jobsahoy_sample`
- Open the `.env` file we created earlier, and edit:
  - `DATABASE_USER`, edit this and set it to your MySQL user name if it is other than `root`
  - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, set MySQL user password that you had used to initially setup
- Having the `jobsahoy_sample` database schema selected, [run the all queries](https://world.siteground.com/tutorials/php-mysql/mysql-workbench/#:~:text=To%20do%20that%2C%20first%20select,field%20to%20run%20the%20query.) that are in `db-setup.sql` to initialise the database with dummy data and table schema.

#### Setting up the website

- After the project dependencies are installed, we create a build of our app. (_with npm as example_)

```
npm run build
```

- We now run the build version using the following command.

```
npm run start
```

You can now access the app in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) !

Unfortunately at the moment, the project is **not** open for contributions.

### Additional

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
